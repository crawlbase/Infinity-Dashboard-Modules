# Infinity Dashboard Modules

👋 Hi There! This is a repository of all the modules bundled with [Infinity Dashboard](https://infinitydashboard.com/) as well as some user contributed modules. 

## What is Infinity Dashboard?
Infinity Dashboard is the best way to track anything you want on your Mac. You can learn more about it by going [here](https://infinitydashboard.com/).

## How do I make my own module?
We've written [documentation](http://infinitydashboard.com/tutorial/README.html) on how to write your own custom modules [here](http://infinitydashboard.com/tutorial/README.html).

## How do I submit my module?
Contributions are submitted, reviewed, and accepted using GitHub pull requests. [Read this article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for some details.


## Editing existing modules
Some modules require additional resources before they'll work. You can run `npm install` on the module you want to edit to install all the required node modules.

## Can I improve or fix bugs with the existing modules?
Of course, create a pull request with your changes and our development team will look review it.

## Reporting bugs/issues
Issues with any of the modules can be reported by creating a [New Issue](https://github.com/fiplab/Infinity-Dashboard-Modules/issues/new) on this repo. 

Bugs with the Infinity Dashboard Mac App should not be reported here and will be ignored. To report an issue with the Mac App please write in to [our support](https://support.fiplab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

## I have an idea for a module but I don't know how to code
Awesome! We love new ideas, feel free to create a new issue with your idea and we'll look into adding it in the future.
